## Installation

Most of the time you don't need to add this gem to your Gemfile directly (unless you're only collecting your custom metrics):

```ruby
gem 'yabeda'
# Then add monitoring system adapter, e.g.:
# gem 'yabeda-prometheus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

 1. Declare your metrics:

    ```ruby
    Yabeda.configure do
      group :your_app do
        counter   :bells_rang_count, comment: "Total number of bells being rang", tags: %i[bell_size]
        gauge     :whistles_active,  comment: "Number of whistles ready to whistle"
        histogram :whistle_runtime do
          comment "How long whistles are being active"
          unit :seconds
        end
      end
    end
    ```

 2. After your application was initialized and all metrics was declared, you need to apply Yabeda configuration:

    ```ruby
    Yabeda.configure!
    ```

    _If you're using Ruby on Rails then it will be configured automatically!_

 3. Access metric in your app and use it!

    ```ruby
    def ring_the_bell(id)
      bell = Bell.find(id)
      bell.ring!
      Yabeda.your_app.bells_rang_count.increment({bell_size: bell.size}, by: 1)
    end

    def whistle!
      Yabeda.your_app.whistle_runtime.measure do
        # Run your code
      end
    end
    ```

 4. Setup collecting of metrics that do not tied to specific events in you application. E.g.: reporting your app's current state
    ```ruby
    Yabeda.configure do
      # This block will be executed periodically few times in a minute
      # (by timer or external request depending on adapter you're using)
      # Keep it fast and simple!
      collect do
        your_app.whistles_active.set({}, Whistle.where(state: :active).count)
      end
    end
    ```

  5. _Optionally_ setup default tags for all appropriate metrics
     ```ruby
     Yabeda.configure do
       # matches all metrics in all groups
       default_tag :rails_environment, 'production'

       # matches all metrics in the :your_app group
       default_tag :tag_name, 'override', group: :your_app
     end

     # You can redefine them for limited amount of time
     Yabeda.with_tags(rails_environment: 'staging') do
       Yabeda.your_app.bells_rang_count.increment({bell_size: bell.size}, by: 1)
     end
     ```

     **Note**: any usage of `with_tags` **must** have all those tags defined on all metrics that are generated in the block.

  6. _Optionally_ override default tags using precedence:

     The tag precedence from high to low is:

     * Manually specified tags
     * Thread local tags (specified by `Yabeda.with_tags`)
     * Group specific tags
     * Global tags

  7. See the docs for the adapter you're using
  8. Enjoy!

## Available monitoring system adapters

### Maintained by Yabeda

 - Prometheus:

   - [yabeda-prometheus-mmap](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda-prometheus-mmap) — wraps [GitLab's fork of Prometheus Ruby client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/prometheus-client-mmap) which may work better for multi-process application servers.
 - [Datadog](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda-datadog)
 - [NewRelic](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda-newrelic)

### Third-party adapters

These are developed and maintained by other awesome folks:

## Configuration

Configuration is handled by [anyway_config] gem. With it you can load settings from environment variables (which names are constructed from config key upcased and prefixed with `YABEDA_`), YAML files, and other sources. See [anyway_config] docs for details.

Config key | Type     | Default | Description |
---------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
`debug`    | boolean  | `false` | Collects metrics measuring Yabeda performance |

## Debugging metrics

 - Time of collector block run: `yabeda_collect_duration` (segmented by block source location). Collector blocks are used for collecting metrics of application state and usually makes some potentially slow queries to databases, network requests, etc.

These are only enabled in debug mode. To enable it either set `debug` config key to `true` (e.g. by specifying `YABEDA_DEBUG=true` in your environment variables or executing `Yabeda.debug!` in your code).

## Testing

### RSpec

Add the following to your `rails_helper.rb` (or `spec_helper.rb`):

```ruby
require "yabeda/rspec"
```

Now you can use `increment_yabeda_counter`, `update_yabeda_gauge`, and `measure_yabeda_histogram` matchers:

```ruby
it "increments counters" do
  expect { subject }.to increment_yabeda_counter(Yabeda.myapp.foo_count).by(3)
end
```

You can scope metrics by used tags with `with_tags`:

```ruby
it "updates gauges" do
  expect { subject }.to \
    update_yabeda_gauge("some_gauge_name").
    with_tags(method: "command", command: "subscribe")
end
```

Note that tags you specified doesn't need to be exact, but can be a subset of tags used on metric update. In this example updates with following sets of tags `{ method: "command", command: "subscribe", status: "SUCCESS" }` and `{ method: "command", command: "subscribe", status: "FAILURE" }` will make test example to pass.

And check for values with `by` for counters, `to` for gauges, and `with` for gauges and histograms (and you [can use other matchers here](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/3-10/docs/composing-matchers)):

```ruby
expect { subject }.to \
  measure_yabeda_histogram(Yabeda.something.anything_runtime).
  with(be_between(0.005, 0.05))
```

## Roadmap (aka TODO or Help wanted)

 - Ability to change metric settings for individual adapters

   ```rb
   histogram :foo, comment: "say what?" do
     adapter :prometheus do
       buckets [0.01, 0.5, …, 60, 300, 3600]
     end
   end
   ```

 - Ability to route some metrics only for given adapter:

   ```rb
   adapter :prometheus do
     include_group :sidekiq
   end
   ```



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Releasing

 1. Bump version number in `lib/yabeda/version.rb`

    In case of pre-releases keep in mind [rubygems/rubygems#3086](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/3086) and check version with command like `Gem::Version.new(Yabeda::VERSION).to_s`

 2. Fill `CHANGELOG.md` with missing changes, add header with version and date.

 3. Make a commit:

    ```sh
    git add lib/yabeda/version.rb CHANGELOG.md
    version=$(ruby -r ./lib/yabeda/version.rb -e "puts Gem::Version.new(Yabeda::VERSION)")
    git commit --message="${version}: " --edit
    ```

 3. Create annotated tag:

    ```sh
    git tag v${version} --annotate --message="${version}: " --edit --sign
    ```

 4. Fill version name into subject line and (optionally) some description (changes will be taken from changelog and appended automatically)

 5. Push it:

    ```sh
    git push --follow-tags
    ```
