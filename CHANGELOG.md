## Unreleased

### Added

- RSpec matchers `increment_yabeda_counter`, `update_yabeda_gauge`, and `measure_yabeda_histogram` for convenient testing. [#25](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda/pull/25) by [@Envek][]
- Automatic setup of RSpec on `require "yabeda/rspec"`
- Special test adapter that collects metric changes in memory

## 0.10.1 - 2021-08-30

### Fixed

- Compatibility with anyway_config 1.x gem (which is automatically used on older Rubies, older then minimal Ruby 2.5 for anyway_config 2.x)

## 0.10.0 - 2021-07-21

### Added

- Ability to pass a block to `Yabeda::Histogram#measure` to automatically measure its runtime in seconds using [monotonic time](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2018/03/elapsed-time-with-ruby-the-right-way/).
- Debug mode that will enable some additional metrics to help debug performance issues with your usage of Yabeda (or Yabeda itself). Use environment variable `YABEDA_DEBUG` to enable it or call `Yabeda.debug!`.
- Debugging histogram `yabeda_collect_duration` that measures duration of every collect block, as they are used for collecting metrics of application state and usually makes some potentially slow queries to databases, network requests, etc.

### Changed

- Adapters now should use method `Yabeda.collect!` instead of manual calling of every collector block. 

## 0.9.0 - 2021-05-07

### Added

- Ability to set global metric tags only for a specific group [#19](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda/pull/19) by [@liaden]

## 0.8.0 - 2020-08-21

### Added

 - Added railtie to automatically configure Yabeda on Rails: moved from [yabeda-rails](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda-rails) gem. [@Envek]

## 0.7.0 - 2020-08-07

### Added

 - `#increment` and `#decrement` convenience methods for `Yabeda::Gauge`. [#13](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda/pull/13) by [@dsalahutdinov]
 - Ability to use custom step in `#increment` and `#decrement` for gauges. [@Envek]

### Fixed

 - Account for default tags in `Yabeda::Metric#get`. [@Envek]

## 0.6.2 - 2020-08-04

### Fixed

 - Compatibility with plugins (like [yabeda-puma-plugin](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda-puma-plugin)) that for some reason configures itself after Yabeda configuration was already applied by `Yabeda.configure!` (was broken in 0.6.0). [@Envek]

## 0.6.1 - 2020-07-16

### Fixed

 - Compatibility with Ruby < 2.6 due to usage of [new `Hash#merge(*others)` with multiple arguments](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.6.html#hashmerge-with-multiple-arguments) in 0.6.0. [@Envek]

## 0.6.0 - 2020-07-15

### Added

 - `Yabeda.with_tags` to redefine default tags for limited amount of timeâ€“for all metrics measured during a block execution. [@Envek]

### Fixed

 - Default tags were not sent to adapters for metrics declared before `default_tag` declaration. [@Envek]

## 0.5.0 - 2020-01-29

### Added

 - Ability to specify aggregation policy for metrics collected from multiple process and exposed via single endpoint. [@Envek]

   For now it is only used by yabeda-prometheus when official Prometheus client is configured to use file storage for metrics.

## 0.4.0 - 2020-01-28

### Changed

 - Configuration of gem was changed from synchronous (at the moment when `configure` block was executed) to postponed (only on `configure!` method call). [@Envek]

   This should allow to fix problems when metrics from gems are registered too early, before required changes to the monitoring system clients.

## 0.3.0 - 2020-01-15

### Added

 - Ability to specify default tag which value will be automatically added to all metrics. [#7](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda/pull/7) by [@asusikov].

## 0.2.0 - 2020-01-14

### Added

 - Ability to specify an optional list of allowed `tags` as an option to metric declaration. @Envek

   Some monitoring systems clients (like official prometheus client for Ruby) require to declare all possible metric labels upfront.

## 0.1.3 - 2018-12-18

### Added

 - Block-based DSL for defining groups and metrics. @DmitryTsepelev

## 0.1.2 - 2018-10-25

### Fixed

 - Removed accidental dependency from Rails. [@dsalahutdinov]

## 0.1.1 - 2018-10-17

### Changed

 - Renamed evil-metrics gem to yabeda. @Envek

## 0.1.0 - 2018-10-03

 - Initial release of evil-metrics gem. @Envek
